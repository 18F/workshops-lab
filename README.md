# Workshops Lab

Welcome to the 18F Workshops Lab repo — we’re glad you’re here! The goal of this repo is to share workshop facilitation methods, tools and best practices across the 18F team!

## Definitions

*Workshop* - a meeting during which attendees participate in discussions and activities around a particular subject or topic, and through which attendees work towards a particular goal, outcome, artifact, or product

*Facilitator* - a content-neutral person who leads, coordinates, guides, or enables a group of people to have a discussion, bring about an outcome, or navigate a process. The facilitator is a helper who supports the group to do their best thinking and practice as they pursue their objectives. The facilitator often uses a range of fair, open, unobtrusive, indirect, and inclusive processes to bring about synergy, inclusive solutions, and sustainable agreements.

## Best Practices

Victor Udoewa has written up a guide to [Workshop Facilitation Best Practices] (https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/170Ewyl-m2Y8Uk7A9SAekR5clnHNZK3JHK1f9u4KHXNE/edit?usp=sharing) for people looking to improve their workshop facilitation skills. 

Zac Cohn has created [Combined Design Methods for Facilitators] (https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B153Y__G-FCWaUZKR2Z6U0piV0E/view?usp=sharing) 

Alex Bisker and Will Slack have notes and an upcoming blog on [Meeting Facilitation and Leadership] (https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1ZnGbHasZwCGOxB5ULRo0KTeBrY6oiXOvubSZ6VTvLl0/edit?usp=sharing) 

## Workshops Overview
From *Duane Rollins*:
Workshops are facilitated multi-participant experiences that (a) allow a group to collaborate to create something or achieve an outcome, (b) make a group decision when there may be divergent individual opinions, or (c) both.
