# Workshops Lab

Welcome to the 18F Workshops Lab repo — we’re glad you’re here! The goal of this repo is to share workshop facilitation methods, tools and best practices across the 18F team!

## Workshop Facilitation Best Practices

Victor Udoewa has written up a guide to [Workshop Facilitation Best Practices] (https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/170Ewyl-m2Y8Uk7A9SAekR5clnHNZK3JHK1f9u4KHXNE/edit?usp=sharing) for people looking to improve their workshop facilitation skills. You can read more here:

## Definitions

*Workshop* - a meeting during which attendees participate in discussions and activities around a particular subject or topic, and through which attendees work towards a particular goal, outcome, artefact, or product

*Facilitator* - a content-neutral person who leads, coordinates, guides, or enables a group of people to have a discussion, bring about an outcome, or navigate a process. The facilitator is a helper who supports the group to do their best thinking and practice as they pursue their objectives. The facilitator often uses a range of fair, open, unobtrusive, indirect, and inclusive processes to bring about synergy, inclusive solutions, and sustainable agreements.
